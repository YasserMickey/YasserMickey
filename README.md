# Hey there! 👋

**Welcome to my GitHub playground!**

## Who am I? 🤔

- A digital marketing, analytics and e-commerce enthusiast who decided that crunching numbers is just as fun as crunching cookies (both digital and chocolate chip).
- A self-proclaimed **Data Sorcerer**.
- Slightly dangerous with Python, R, PHP, and SQL—handle with care!

## My superpower? 🦸‍♂️

- High business acumen combined with being super tech-savvy. I bridge the gap between business and technology like it's nobody's business (pun intended).

## What am I up to? 🚀

- **Machine Learning Mischief**: Teaching computers to do my homework & other cool stuff.
- **Master's Mayhem**: Projects from my Data Science master's that didn't crash my computer (much).
- **Day Trading Adventures**: Analyzing market trends and pretending I know what the stock market is doing.

## Fun Facts 🎉

- Believe in the motto: "Why do it manually in an hour when you can spend three days coding it to run automatically?"
- My code sometimes works on the first try (miracles do happen).

## Want to Collaborate? 🤝

- Open to cool projects, especially if they involve machine learning, marketing analytics, or magically making money off the futures market.
